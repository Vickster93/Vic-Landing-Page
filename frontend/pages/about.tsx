          <p>Hey! Iâ€™m Victor Maldonado ðŸ‘‹</p>

          <p>Iâ€™ve always loved tinkering with the web and finding new ways to build fast, modern applications. 
          My journey started with the basicsâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”but I quickly wanted more of a challenge. 
          Thatâ€™s when I jumped into Next.js and NestJS with TypeScript.</p>

          <p>To be honest, itâ€™s been a pretty steep learning curve. Luckily, Iâ€™ve been using ChatGPT as my coding buddy 
          along the way, and itâ€™s helped me figure things out faster. For example, I built my first landing page 
          in just two days!</p>

          <p>Right now, my focus is on really understanding TypeScript logic and getting more comfortable with how 
          Next.js and NestJS work together. Next.js is running the frontendâ€”styling and pagesâ€”while NestJS handles 
          my backend API calls, which update my projects as I create and add them.</p>

          <p><strong>My main objective is to learn using ChatGPT as my teacher. In fact, it even helped refine this summary!</strong></p>

          <p>This blog is where Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™m learning, the mistakes I make, and the cool stuff I build along the way ðŸš€</p>
